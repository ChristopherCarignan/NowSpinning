# Now Spinning
Identifies music from a turntable and displays album art and song info. Music is identified using the AudioTag.info music recognition service and album art is retrieved using Last.fm

Now Spinning will continuously listen on an audio port. If sound is sensed, an audio sample will be recorded for recognition and displayed on the screen. So you can run Now Spinning indefinitely and song info will be updated as new songs and new albums are spinning!
